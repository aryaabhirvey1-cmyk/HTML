<h3><b>Shingeki no kyogin:</b></h3>
<p> Set in a world where humanity lives within enormous walled cities to protect themselves 
    from gigantic humanoid creatures known as Titans, <b>Attack on Titan</b> is a story of survival, 
    freedom, and vengeance. The series follows <i>Eren Yeager</i> and his friends as they join the 
    military to fight the Titans after their hometown is destroyed. 
    The anime is known for its deep political themes, complex characters, and shocking twists 
    that question the very nature of humanity and power. The story begins with a shocking event — a colossal Titan breaches Wall Maria, 
  allowing smaller Titans to invade and destroy Eren Yeager’s hometown. 
  Witnessing his mother’s death, Eren vows to annihilate every Titan. 
  Along with his childhood friends, <i>Mikasa Ackerman</i> and <i>Armin Arlert</i>, he joins the military’s Survey Corps, 
  a special branch that ventures outside the walls to fight Titans and uncover their mysteries.</p>
